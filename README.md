# Scraping
This tool performs nightly pulls of the city of Tulsa's previously posted meetings and upcoming meetings.

Data are stored in the [data folder](https://github.com/tulsa-policy-institute/tulsa-civic-meetup/tree/master/data).

There is one file called [upcoming](https://github.com/tulsa-policy-institute/tulsa-civic-meetup/tree/master/data/upcoming.json) that is refreshed nightly and shows all meetings after the date of the time of the scrape. This can be useful for showing future meetings across all boards!
